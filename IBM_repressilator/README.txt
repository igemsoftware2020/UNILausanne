We were concerned about how long bacteria would oscillate synchronized in a gut-like environment. To assess this, we initially explored existing deterministic models of the repressilator to later create our own discrete individual-based model. Cells were simplified to a list of proteins (LacI, TetR, CI) plus a counter of undergone divisions, and we set the rules to determine how they change their protein amount, divide or die in two different environments (one or two dimensions). We validated the model with previous simulations and experimental findings and were able to show how the variability in cell division decouples the oscillations.
