Welcome!
Here you have the code for the dry lab part of the iGEM Unilausanne 2020 project. 
You can check our project here: https://2020.igem.org/Team:UNILausanne
In particular, this is the modelling section: https://2020.igem.org/Team:UNILausanne/Model
Scripts are organised in folders similarly as the figures they produce are organized in our wiki page
Just to warn you, we are not experts in coding nor modelling, we just tried our best. 
All the scripts were run in the pyton IDE spyder, version 4.0.1, under python 3.7
You will find more tips, clarifications and information comented (#) in our scripts.
For any question you can contact igem@unil.ch or igem.unil@gmail.com
